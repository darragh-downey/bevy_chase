# Bevy Chase

## Intro

Based off [rust-invaders](https://github.com/jeremychone-channel/rust-invaders) by [@jeremychone](https://github.com/).

A simple demo on how to build for multiple build targets now that [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) supports WASM.

## Future state

* Android
* Linux
* Mac
* Windows
* WASM
* Boids (candidate for shared lib)
* Cloudflare-workers (single threaded only for now <https://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler-v2-beta/>)
